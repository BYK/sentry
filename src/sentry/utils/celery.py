    Register a callback to be run when celery subprocess shuts down. This is
    not 100% failsafe (in case the Celery task OOMs, experiences hard-timeouts
    or segfaults) but makes it relatively easy to produce to Kafka from celery
    tasks, reuse the producer across tasks and only flush the batch when the
    worker subprocess is being shut down (see max_tasks_per_child)

    This is specific to celery, in other environments such as uwsgi, other
    hooks need to be used.

    The Sentry Python SDK has a more robust and battle-tested variant of this
    in its Celery integration, but that one is more complicated as it is
    supposed to work under Celery 3.
